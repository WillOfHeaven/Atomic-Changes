# Atomic-Changes
An initiative to make hackathons better.

- This project is the part of the Hack Devpost hackathon.
# Inspiration

Devsprint'22 was my first hackathon for which it had left a lasting impression on me. There the general incoherence among all first time hackers like my team about what **we wanted to build**, Even though we had a general idea about our broad objective we didn't have **a proper plan** upon which proper action can be taken and **progress can be properly monitered** by the team leader. In later hackathons too **especially solo and online ones** this came to my notice and here I have tried my best to work on it and give some solution to make first time hackers have a better expericence.

## Features

A sharable to-do list for the who group would be a nice idea, they maybe be given a 2 hour or an hour of brainstorming season where this to do lit or help guide would give them proper steps which cna be worked upon to get a clear veiw of what they wnat to make, Access to experts and pexpericneced hackers shoudl be made available to them.

We can also work upon individual and teamto do list wher the team members can monitor the work done by the differrent members. Here note should be taken that each member of the group shoud have proper and well defined duties. Divison of duties in teams seemed very improtant to me. Members can also have their personal to do list so that they can amke proper advancements in their own duties themeselves. If such is made available by devpost it would surely work like a charm.

Another thing that came out as an issue to me was now with the advent of AI and AI supported tools developing websites, presentations and web apps has become quite easy. Now whether such third party stuff is allowed or not is a question that needs to be properly answerd to. I have often seen people use readmy made sites as a base for their projects. Devpost perhaps needs to come up with a solution which would act as a asafeguards from project which have AI generated and 3rd party content which have not been allowed.
