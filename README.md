# Atomic-Changes
An initiative to make hackathons better.


- This project is the part of the Hack Devpost hackathon.
# Inspiration

Devsprint'22 was my first hackathon for which it had left a lasting impression on me. There the general incoherence among all first time hackers like my team about what **we wanted to build**, Even though we had a general idea about our broad objective we didn't have **a proper plan** upon which proper action can be taken and **progress can be properly monitered** by the team leader. In later hackathons too **especially solo and online ones** this came to my notice and here I have tried my best to work on it and give some solution to make first time hackers have a better expericence.


## Features

**A sharable to-do list** for the whole group would be a nice idea, they maybe be given a 2 hour or an hour of brainstorming season where this to do lit or help guide would give them proper steps which can be worked upon to get a clear view of what they want to make, Access to experts and experienced hackers should be made available to them.

We can also work upon individual and team based to do list's where the team members can monitor the work done by the different members. Here note should be taken that each member of the group should have proper and well defined duties. Division of duties in teams seemed very important to me. Members can also have their personal to do list so that they can amke proper advancements in their own duties themselves. If such is made available by devpost it would surely work like a charm.

Another thing that came out as an issue to me was now with the advent of AI and AI supported tools developing websites, presentations and web apps has become quite easy. Now whether such third party stuff is allowed or not is a question that needs to be properly answered to. I have often seen people use reedy made sites as a base for their projects. Devpost perhaps needs to come up with a solution which would act as a safeguards from project which have AI generated and 3rd party content which have not been allowed.

## How I built it

The solution build by me is basically a presentation of what can be done about those issues using 
Canva.

## Challenges I ran into

The challenges which we ran into included considering whether the issues that we were observing were really issues at all.  Making our solution as realistic as possible also required quite an effort.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned

I learned Markdown and this helped me improve my writing and problem solving skills.

## What's next for Atomic Changes

Atomic Changes is all about small changes can compile into big results over time , I hope to at least 100 more hackathons in the feature (hackathons always has this energy which brings out innovation from inside you) and bring about more such improvements in this wonderful event!
